# POS System

## Overview

The **Point of Sale (POS) system** is designed to efficiently manage product sales, inventory, and reporting for businesses. The system is split into two main parts: the **frontend**, built with **ReactJS** and **Tailwind CSS**, and the **backend**, built with **FastAPI**. Both components communicate seamlessly via RESTful APIs.

The system includes features such as product management, transaction handling, user authentication, reporting, and more. The backend uses **PostgreSQL** for data storage, ensuring scalability and reliability.

## Backend (FastAPI)

### Project Overview

The backend of the POS system is built with **FastAPI**, providing the necessary RESTful APIs to manage products, transactions, users, and reports. It is modular, organized into separate apps for handling authentication, product management, transaction management, and reporting.

The backend is connected to a **PostgreSQL** database, ensuring the system can scale and maintain reliable data storage.

### Features

- **Product Management**

  - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for product entries.
  - Image upload and handling, stored locally in the `static/images` directory.
  - Stock level tracking and automatic inventory updates after sales.

- **Transaction Management**

  - Record and process sales transactions.
  - Automatically update product stock based on sales.
  - Support for multiple payment methods (e.g., cash, credit, digital).

- **User Authentication and Management**

  - Role-based access control (e.g., Admin, Shopkeeper).
  - JWT-based authentication to ensure secure access to the system.

- **Reporting**

  - Generate detailed sales reports (daily, weekly, monthly).
  - Generate inventory reports showing low stock items and stock value.

- **Database**
  - Uses **PostgreSQL** for scalability and reliability.
